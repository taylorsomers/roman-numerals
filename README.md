# Roman Numeral Converter

  ### By Taylor Somers

## Description

  This website is a work in progress designed to practice the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) model for creating programs with end performance in mind. While its functionality to this point is marginal, it does show the iterative process involved in BDD and has been integral in cultivating my understanding of the BDD process that we will be using in further website builds at Epicodus.
